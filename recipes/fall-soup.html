    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Cozy Autumn Wild Rice Soup is made with fresh seasonal vegetables and greens, hearty wild rice, and a deliciously zesty, creamy broth (made with either coconut milk or cream). Instant Pot and stovetop options included!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups vegetable stock (or chicken stock)</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked wild rice</li>
        <li>8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, diced</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 large (about 1 pound) sweet potato, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoon Old Bay seasoning</li>
        <li>1 (14-0z) can unsweetend coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 large handfuls of kale, roughly chopped with thick stems removed</li>
        <li>fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine base ingredients. Combine vegetable stock, wild rice, mushrooms, garlic, carrots, celery, sweet potato, onion, bay leaf and Old Bay seasoning in the bowl of an Instant Pot pressure cooker.  Stir briefly to combine.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook. Cover and cook on manual (high pressure) for 25 minutes.  Let the Instant Pot rest and naturally release the pressure for 10 minutes.  Then carefully open the vent and quick release the remaining pressure.  Remove lid and discard the bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Add final ingredients. Add the coconut milk and kale to the soup, and stir gently until combined.  Taste and season with salt and pepper (plus any extra Old Bay seasoning, if you would like) as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
