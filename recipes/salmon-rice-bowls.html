        <li>2 tablespoons of honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sriracha, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauge, or gluten-free tamari</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced or grated fresh ginger</li>
         <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless salmon filets</li>
         <li>3 persian cucumbers, thinly sliced</li>
         <li>1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar, plus more as needed</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
         <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
         <li>3 cups cooked short-grain brown rice</li>
         <li>Furikake seasoning, or seseme seeds, for garnish</li>
     </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the broiler with a rack about 6 inches below it. Line a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick foil.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the honey, sriracha, soy sauce, and ginger; stir with a fork until the honey dissolves</li>
        <li>Cut the salmon into 1-inch cubes and  place them on the baking sheet, leaving a bit of space between each piece.</li>
        <li>Brush the salmon with the glaze and cook under the broiler for 3 to 4 minutes, or until itâ€™s easily flaked with a fork and golden on top.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the sliced cucumber with the rice vinegar, sesame oil, and salt.</li>
        <li>To serve, please 3/4 cup rice in each bowl. Divide and top with salmon, sliced avocado, cucumber, and a drizzle of sriracha, if desired, plus a sprinkle of furikake seasoning. If you'd like a little more acidity , add just a dash of rice vinegar.</li>
     </ol>
